# TEInterview

Please find inside this repo, my completed Code Review Questionaire and Implemented Design Component.

I was very conscious of the time limits for each task and managed to complete both to a point that I was satisfied with.
However, I am prepared to discuss any elements of the assignments that I did not manage to fully complete such as the last talking points in the code review and the missing object in the design implementation.
These few outstanding part of the assignment were within my capabilities but in the interest of giving an accurate representation of my ability I chose to adhere to the time limit.

I would say that overall, I am pleased with the element I managed to produce in 40 minutes. I am conscious that it turned out quite
"div/class soupy" but my main concern was to produce the element as quickly and accurately as possible in the allowed time.
I feel confident that if I were to review the code at a later time I would be able to dry it up somewhat and improve the elements structuring.

Thank you for your consideration.
